This article is not code-intensive, so you won’t need much coding experience. You do need to have a **VsCode** and a **Netlify** account. You can create a Netlify account [here ](https://app.netlify.com/)and download Vs Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

<br/><br/>

### **Building our simple static webpage**

<br/><br/>

The webpage we will host consists of a single HTML file with minimal CSS. Here’s what the code in our HTML file should look like:



<iframe width="100%" height="261" frameborder="0" src="https://snipphub.github.io/?l=html#XQAAAQAlAQAAAAAAAAAFEAWsO98VkFogy+PXWxCfH6yVVEluvADEai9/8WZjk+V9m0vRJq/SRSQR4cmcRKLkpTIEQl5fVZMoMXmkd8lUeVmvFFzRIizZQgIe24iLgPLxKhe9inxC2BrzzzC9ej0MJSHZn588msbaWOXQTvXMcBOw6NYmx3YMdMfsMZMSoipTctQyWkWnJ9P9/yCBcFVB4ZlxzPz/aiqpQ1uHf27EoZr4M3Sz9tD0Isv7JHzKHlfFdtrPAA0BynJmaeQZdBRLVsWVgpESaBwZW1mWAnsoFqMKdgtsX/8aFP4A"></iframe>



Now that you have **VsCode**. **Open** and make a directory called **Website** and file **index.html** and paste the code below.

<br/><br/>

Now that we have our code written, we need to put it on Netlify.

<br/><br/>

### **Netlify Drop**

<br/><br/>

**Netlify Drop** is a Netlify service that allows developers to host their sites by simply dragging and dropping the site’s folders.

To use this, we need to visit the Netlify Drop website [here](https://app.netlify.com/drop). Once we are on the site, we simply need to drop a folder containing all the files for our static website in the space provided, and we’ll be redirected to a dashboard similar to the one shown below. We can then get the **link** to our newly deployed site.

<br/><br/>

### **Conclusion**

<br/><br/>

Congratulations! We have successfully hosted our simple webpage on Netlify and secured it with HTTPS
