This article is not code-intensive, so you won’t need much coding experience. You do need to have a **VsCode** and a **Netlify** account. You can create a Netlify account [here ](https://app.netlify.com/)and download Vs Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

<br/><br/>

### **Building our simple static webpage**

<br/><br/>

The webpage we will host consists of a single HTML file with minimal CSS. Here’s what the code in our HTML file should look like:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>Deploying a basic webpage to netlify</h1> 
</body>
</html>
```

Now that you have **VsCode**. **Open** and make a directory called **Website** and file **index.html** and paste the code below.

<br/><br/>

Now that we have our code written, we need to put it on Netlify.

<br/><br/>

### **Netlify Drop**

<br/><br/>

**Netlify Drop** is a Netlify service that allows developers to host their sites by simply dragging and dropping the site’s folders.

To use this, we need to visit the Netlify Drop website [here](https://app.netlify.com/drop). Once we are on the site, we simply need to drop a folder containing all the files for our static website in the space provided, and we’ll be redirected to a dashboard similar to the one shown below. We can then get the **link** to our newly deployed site.

### **Conclusion**

<br/><br/>

Congratulations! We have successfully hosted our simple webpage on Netlify and secured it with HTTPS
