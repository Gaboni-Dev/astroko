Addresses

- smart contracts
- wallets

Ethereum wallets

- apps
- not the same as storing in an exchange
- allow you to interact with the blockchain using a unique address(es)
- store crypto assets
- you connect these wallets to dapps to do things like minting NFTs
- think of this as "logging in" -- the wallet address is your unique blockchain identity

Security concerns

- don't wanna rely on an exchange account
- extension can be subject to scams
- try to mitigate risk with layers of separation

Wallet Strategy

Different types of wallets

- extension (MetaMask)
- "cold" wallet (Argent / Rainbow / Coinbase Wallet)
- Hardware (Ledger / )

MetaMask

- easy to use
- supported by most browsers
- good to use for development purposes
- most suspect to scams because they interact with the browser, which could have malicious scripts
- I use this as my "public" wallet
- Don't store much in here -- just enough to fund transactions/gas

Argent / Rainbow / Coinbase

- mobile apps
- also have an address and store assets
- you can browser dapps, swap coins, access defi, etc.
- i use this to hold my "portfolio" or "reserves"
- i'm new to defi, but this is the wallet i'd use to that
- like my vanguard account

Hardware wallet

-
- where i store things i intend to hodl
- i have a miniscule amount of BTC and don't plan on selling
- that'll go in the hardware wallet

Downsides

- transferring between wallets costs gas
- sometimes can't get funds into public wallet due to network congrestion in time for nft drops
